# KNN_for_image_segmentation_dataset
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify instances from the Image Segmentation dataset. The dataset contains labeled image segments, with features derived from image characteristics. This implementation explores preprocessing techniques and evaluates their impact on model performance.
